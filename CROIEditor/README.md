# CROIEditor

This class lets the user view an image (2D, or a single slice) and draw multiple ROIs of various shapes on the image, with a preview window showing their current work. The binary image mask, mask labels, and number of masks are all available as output data.

## Usage

In order to use this class, reference the function `example.m` (provided by author Jonas Reber) or edit the extra function provided here (`getROI.m`) created after testing this tool with a 32-bit float (`float32`) MRI image loaded from a `RAW` image file.
