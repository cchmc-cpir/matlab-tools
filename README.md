# matlab-tools
Any interesting one-off MATLAB functions/scripts that could be useful to others.

## Using this repository
Create a new folder for your function/script/other to keep things separated. Make sure you title the folder/files using descriptive names, and include a very short README.md file (like this one) with directions for using your contribution in the sub-folder. This will make it easy for people to know exactly what they're looking at.
